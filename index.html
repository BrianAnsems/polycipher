			<p>This project is a poly-alphabetic cipher. In the <strong>Word Key</strong> field, a word can be entered. Plain text can then be entered into the text-area. Once submitted, an enciphered version is returned on the right side of the page.</p>
			<p>Enciphering is a process of creating several cipher alphabets generated by taking each letter of the key word, and then creating an alphabet that begins with that letter. For example, a key word of 'HOT' will create 3 cipher alphabets. The first alphabet will begin with the letter 'H'; the second alphabet will begin with 'O'; and, the last alphabet will begin with 'T'.
			<p>Each letter of the plaintext is enciphered according to the appropriate cipher alpahbet. Every first letter will be enciphered accoring to the first cipher alphebet that begins with the first letter of the key word; the second letter will be enciphered according to the second cipher alphabet that begins with the second letter of the key word, and so on.</p>
			<p>For example, if we take the key word 'HOT', and enter the plaintext 'aaa', the cipher text 'hot' will be returned.</p>
			<p>The cipher will loop through the plaintext, dividing the letters into groups that match the length of the keyword. So, a 6 letter word will be encipher by the key word 'HOT' two times. The first and fourth letter will be enciphered accordning to first letter of the key word. The second and fifth letter will be enciphered according to the second letter of the key word. Finally, the third and sixth letter's will be enciphered according to the third letter of the key word.</p>
			<p>Current plans are to combine the mono-alphabtic cipher project and the poly-alphabetic cihper into one project.</p>
